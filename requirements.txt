# Python 3.11 compatibility notes (read me if you upgrade Python)
#
# General
# - Always upgrade build tools first: `python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel`
# - PyTorch is installed separately (see README). v2.3.1 supports Python 3.11.
#
# Numeric stack
# - numpy==1.26.3 works on py311. If SciPy wheels conflict, allow a minor bump
#   within 1.26.x (e.g., 1.26.4) or install SciPy from a version that has py311 wheels.
# - If `scipy` fails to build on py311, try pinning to a release with prebuilt wheels
#   for your OS/Python (or install via conda-forge), e.g.:
#   - `pip install "scipy~=1.11"` (Linux/macOS) or use conda if wheels are unavailable.
#
# WhisperX stack (optional, only if you enable WhisperX ASR)
# - Ensure ctranslate2 and faster-whisper have py311 wheels before installing whisperx:
#   `pip install --upgrade "ctranslate2" "faster-whisper"`
# - If whisperx installation fails from pip, prefer the GitHub install per its README.
#
# FunASR
# - If `funasr` installation fails on py311, try upgrading to a newer release or
#   follow FunASR's official install guide for py311-compatible versions.
#
# ModelScope (used by CosyVoice)
# - If modelscope has dependency conflicts on py311, try upgrading it first:
#   `pip install --upgrade modelscope`
#   If still failing, consult modelscope release notes for a py311-supported version.
#
# WeTextProcessing / Pynini
# - WeTextProcessing depends on `pynini`. Install pynini via conda-forge,
#   which provides py311 builds:
#   `conda install -y pynini==2.1.5 -c conda-forge`
#
# Others
# - librosa==0.10.2 supports py311.
# - lightning==2.2.4 works on py311 but depends on torch â€” install torch first per README.
# - diffusers / accelerate generally support py311; keep them updated if you hit issues.
# - If `pyarrow` wheels are not found for your platform, upgrade pip and retry.
